=Entain Automation Coding Task=

First of all, Thank you for the providing me with the opportunity to showcase my thought process and skills.
This task is composed of the right amount of skill assessment and logic building that may be required in a QA Engineer's journey, and it was an excellent brain excercise overall. Although, it started off with some basic stuff, but eventually required quite a lot of thinking
and needed understanding of how the application was working. Though I timeboxed the task to 2.5 as mentioned in the document. An additional hour was used to get knowledge of interceptions as it happens to be something I have not used in the past.

To start with, I preferred using JS instead of TS, therefore; created a new projected and migrated all the necessasry filed (made sure to change the extension). 

Note: got rid of the tsconfig.json file 


**Task Requirements**
-> Was able to do the mentioned tests in the spec files 
-> Was only able to automate one test in the countdown-timer spec file (1 halfway through) but I've marked it as skip
-> Able to do the mentioned tests on content spec file
-> Did a bit of learning for interceptions before implementing it, but it was fun and good learning
-> You should be able to access the branch 'test/Shaheeruddin-Ahmed'


**Bugs/Issue**
-> The application was acting flaky at times, instances where a timer would jump between positive and negative value for a venue. This caused me trouble while writing tests and testing them
